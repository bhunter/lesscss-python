A LessCSS Compiler in Python
============================

Probably full of bugs with "potentially" all features apart from namespaces and
accessors.

Currently this has all the features that I require, but lacks full
compatibility with LessCSS_.

Due to a request it is now hosted on Github
https://github.com/metalshark/lesscss-python and may receive traction towards
gaining full feature parity.

Open to anyone wanting to advance this project (it does not use a lexer/parser
as such as it seemed more trouble than its worth to learn how they work in
order to build this).
